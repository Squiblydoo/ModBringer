# ModBringer
ModBringer a Mod Loader for the game ScourgeBringer by Flying Oak Games.

ModBringer's only functionality at this time is to provide an interface for managing community made Skins/Texture packs for the game.

At the current time, two skins exist for ScourgeBringer version 1.52:
- Rel (the character from the ScourgeBringer prequel comicbook)
- Yung Venus aka YV (from the game Nuclear Throne by Vlambeer)

ModBringer is currently only compatible with Windows, but it is planned to be compatible with other operating systems.

ModBringer hopes to change over time in order to allow for new modifications to be added to the game.
