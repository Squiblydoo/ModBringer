# ModBringer
ModBringer a Mod Loader for the game ScourgeBringer by Flying Oak Games.

ModBringer's only functionality at this time is to provide an interface for managing community made Skins/Texture packs for the game.

At the current time, two skins exist for ScourgeBringer version 1.52:
- Rel (the character from the ScourgeBringer prequel comicbook)
- Yung Venus aka YV (from the game Nuclear Throne by Vlambeer)

ModBringer is currently only compatible with Windows, but it is planned to be compatible with other operating systems.

ModBringer hopes to change over time in order to allow for new modifications to be added to the game. 


# Usage
1. Download the latest release (e.g Windowsx86-ModBringer-Release.zip) https://github.com/Squiblydoo/ModBringer/releases/
2. Unzip the files.
3. Run "Modbringer.exe"
4. Select Setup option.
5. Select desired skin option.
6. Launch game and use selected skin.

If at any time, you have unexpected difficulty loading skins or the game, please use Steam to verify game files and restore game files. 
ModBringer backs up the default skins for safe keeping, but something could still go wrong.
