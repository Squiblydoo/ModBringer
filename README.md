(In order to include a community skin in ModBringer, make a folder for the skin next to the other skins and include the skin in that folder. You will make one folder per skin.)

ModBringer is currently only compatible with Windows, but it is planned to be compatible with other operating systems.

# Usage
1. Download the latest release for your operating system: https://github.com/Squiblydoo/ModBringer/releases/
2. Unzip the files.
3. Run "Modbringer.exe", or on Linux, in a terminal run `.\modbringer`
4. Select Setup option.
5. Select desired skin option.
6. Launch game and use selected skin.

If at any time, you have unexpected difficulty loading skins or the game, please use Steam to verify game files and restore game files. 
ModBringer backs up the default skins for safe keeping, but something could still go wrong.

This is a video of using ModBringer to configure for the Weapons and Blood modpack:

# Adding your own modifications (Advanced Users)
If you want to add your own skin to the launcher for personal use, follow this procedure.
1. Create a folder in the "Skins" folder in the "Mod" folder next to where you saved ModBringer.exe.
2. Put your an "xnb" file named identically to the Sprite sheet you are replacing.
3. Run ModBringer option 2 "Setup/Update". This will copy the files where they need to go.
4. Your new skin should now appear in the propper ModBringer menu.

# [TÜRKÇEGETİREN](https://github.com/Squiblydoo/TURKCEGETIREN)
TÜRKÇEGETİREN (TurkishBringer) is a separate program which allows you to play ScourgeBringer in Turkish. It is not compatible with other skins but can be used with gameplay mods. 
The tool itself was created by Squiblydoo and the translation/sprite edits were done by Hugo the Waffle. Hugo also translated TÜRKÇEGETİREN into Turkish.
