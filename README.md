# ModBringer
ModBringer a Mod Loader for the game ScourgeBringer by Flying Oak Games.

ModBringer is currently only compatible with Windows, but it is planned to be compatible with other operating systems.

ModBringer hopes to change over time in order to allow for new modifications to be added to the game. 

Please follow to keep up with the many updates coming soon.

# Usage
1. Download the latest release (e.g Windowsx86-ModBringer-Release.zip) https://github.com/Squiblydoo/ModBringer/releases/
2. Unzip the files.
3. Run "Modbringer.exe"
4. Select Setup option.
5. Select desired skin option.
6. Launch game and use selected skin.

If at any time, you have unexpected difficulty loading skins or the game, please use Steam to verify game files and restore game files. 
ModBringer backs up the default skins for safe keeping, but something could still go wrong.

# Adding your own modifications (Advanced Users)
If you want to add your own skin to the launcher for personal use, follow this procedure.
1. Create a folder in the "Skins" folder in the "Mod" folder next to where you saved ModBringer.exe.
2. Put your an "xnb" file named identically to the Sprite sheet you are replacing.
3. Run ModBringer option 2 "Setup/Update". This will copy the files where they need to go.
4. Your new skin should now appear in the propper ModBringer menu.
